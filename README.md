This is our repository for our website: QuickFic!
First download all the files.
Then once you have downloaded the files, head to the app.js file then from there go to line 58, copy the local database or use your own local database and place that where  "process.env.DATABASE_URL" is inside single quotes.
after that open up your command line in the folder and then run the following commands:
- npm install
- npm run dev

and then you should be good to go :)

If you want to access our web application via our heroku app here is the url for that: https://quickfic.herokuapp.com/
